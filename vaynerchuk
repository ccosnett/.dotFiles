1) don't dwell on the past, keep failing like a lunatic!

2) don't give a fuck! Let people laugh! Pin them against the wall when you are king.

3) Use your anger, have a chip on your shoulder. Focus the chip into a supply of manic energy. Get fight!

4) Explore! Try shit!

5) Work 16 hours a day! Le bron got up at 5:30 and did 4000 basketball throws a day every day.

6) Love getting punched in the mouth! Enjoy it! Be crazy! Makes me wanna stick it to everyone who judged you.

7) Love being an underdog. 

8) People's attention is all on their social media! Harvest their minds, Harvest their attention.

9) If your not talented at something keep trying things until you find something your good at!

10) Live with a fucking fire in your mind!

11) Don't let people crush you and put you in your place!

12) Keep attempting and failing! Count the failures. If you fail 99 times in a row then only then switch goals.

13) Burn the past! Don't be introspective. Do! Don't think! Don't analyze! Fucking Do!
