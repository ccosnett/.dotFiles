lsWHY DO YOU WISH TO PERSUE A HIGHER DEGREE BY RESEARCH.

It is only by research and experiment that we as scientists can push the frontiers of progress and discovery. As a third-fourth year physics student, I am being trained extensively in using the scientific method.

I am very interested in this area of research and plan to use the skills gained during my BsC years, to the best of my ability.

Worthwhile research takes time, and careful evaluation of data and I would be so glad of the chance (opportunity) to have this exclusive phase in my life where time could be savoured, and without the additional pressures of having to do other work elsewhere.

I could dedicate myself and all my skills to a valuable cause.

Without the patronage of this scheme, I would find it very difficult to persue what has been my dream for many years.

Research by scientific method is a tried and tested way to evaluate data, which as a result gives us an idea of the likelihood of a particular hypothesis to be true or not.

RESEARCH IS THE ONLY OPTION.
RESEARCH IS THE ONLY WAY.

{
    -> Exoplanets and artificial intelligence are going to be important to humanity in the future.
    -> Our planet may not last forever, And we may need the aid of clever algorithms to combat many problems we face in the world today.a

   -> Regardless of the outcome we as human beings have always been interested in our place in the cosmos. It is the essence of being human to be curious.

    -> Why should we be afraid to explore what could lie beyond the known borders of the universe.
   -> Like the pit poney reared in the dark when brought up to the light can never see. There will always be people who are afraid to be educated. And to see.

    -> I've always been curious in this area of science. I have been influenced by carl sagan who had this open mindedness. Away back in 1979 and I am delighted by the open mindedness of contemporaries like Elon musk who is not afraid to dream.

    -> and sees endless possibilities in what some people may consider un-achievable.

    -> It is the hallmark of my generation, to be computer.

    -> The whole essence of university is to open up the endless possibilities imaginable in the human mind.

    -> But peer-reviewed scientific research is the only thing that will carry weight no matter how fanciful I am.

    -> This is why I would really like to do  a PHD in my chosen field.
    -> And to be handed a golden oppertunity to carry out research (In the university setting ) while I am still young .

    -> My grand father in the 1930s, met

    -> Automation, Mind amplification.
    -> This needs to be automated at scale.

    -> A new sort of microscope has been invented.

    If I don't get the funding I am going try and do this research anyway.

WHY DO THINK THERE IS A SPECIFIC DEMAND FOR THE SKILL SET YOU WISH TO BUILD.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))


{

    Skill Set

    -> I'll become an artist, whose palette and brushes will be alogorithms, data and experimental technique.

    -> My paint will be deep neural networks.

    -> The picture I will create will be an automated computer system that detects distant exoplanets.

    -> During this degree I hope to master the art of neural networks and use them in all my computer programs for any task imaginable. Peter Norvig of google advocates this , and says that they should be the first tool in any developers tool box.

    -> A neural network is computer programs which programs itself to do arbitrary non-trivial tasks given examples in the form of data.

    -> Examples of tasks include playing, driving self driving cars,
    -> pattern recognition in medical.
    -> The skill set I hope to build is a highly versatile and adaptable skill which I hope will be applied ubiquitously in all domains possible. (Possibly as an aid to other medical diagnosis.)
    -> This shall my golden hammer
    -> This shall be the first tool in my scientists toolbox.
    ->
    

}


There is a demand because this technology saves time.
TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME TIME

time is of the essence when one is challenged by climate change, cancer, war.

As Dr Leila Denmark (Pediatrician) said before she died at age 102.

(ref :: BMJ)

“Doing what you don’t like is work,” she was fond of saying. “Doing what you like is play.”


Neural Networks and Astronomy have been my hobby for the past 4 years.
