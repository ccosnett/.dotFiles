\section{Early Education}
\textit{Please provide any additional information relevant to your academic background which should include the name, location and dates of any training courses attended.}

\subsection{School Years}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item I was interested in simple electronics as a school boy. I made robots that navigated my room. Later on I made an automatic physiotherapy machine for the had and printed self designed circuit boards using chemicals and a laser printer in my room at home. I used a 3D printer at school to print the gear box for the hand physio machine. I designed and soldered the electronic components from first principles.

  \item I was keen on playing the piano as a teenager and did music for my leaving cert. I feel that the hand-eye co-ordination necessary for playing the piano transfers quite well to computer programming. I achieved piano grade 6 in 2009.
    
  \item I enjoyed maths at school and I went for extra voluntary maths tutorials on Saturdays at Maynooth college. I took part in Irish maths Olympiads in Limerick and came 14th.
    
  \item I designed and made a custom wooden desk for doing my electronics at home using the Solid Works CAD system. This desk was also equipped with a homemade air extraction system.
  
\end{enumerate}





\subsection{University Years}
 During spare time taught myself to utilize the following software packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Solid Work}  (Computer Aided Design) 2011
\item \textbf{Sibelius 6} (Music Notation and Composition) 2012
\end{itemize}

Spent the following approximate number of hours learning the following computer languages between the years 2012 and 2016:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Python:}             100 hours
\item \textbf{MATLAB:}            1000 hours
\item \textbf{Mathematica:}       3500 hours
\item \textbf{C:}                   50 hours
\item \textbf{Haskell:}            100 hours
\item \textbf{Prolog:}             300 hours
\item \textbf{LaTeX:}              200 hours
                 
\item \textbf{EMACS with AUCTEX:}  200 hours  

\end{itemize}

During my university year in 2015 and especially in 2016 (when I dropped out of University for a year following a computer game addiction problem and various temporary psychological hassles) I reformed my lifestyle and began learning various computer languages. I completed several MOOCs oneline:
\subsection{MOOCs}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Machine Learning:} Andrew Ng (Coursera)
  \item  \textbf{Introduction to Programming with MATLAB:} Vanderbilt University
  \item   \textbf{Introduction to Computer Science with Python:} MIT (EDX)

    

    
\end{itemize}

Other MOOCs I Watched the lectures but not actually complete:

-Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: Keith Devlin (Coursera)
-Machine Learning: Pedro Domingos (Coursera)
-Introduction to Logic: Michael Genesereth (Coursera)
-Artificial Intelligence: (Berkeley) Dan Klein, Peter Abbeel (EDX)
-Differential Equations: Paul Blanchard (Coursera)


I have always read about the history and developement of science, Computing and Astronomy


I worked through the following online courses in ~~2015 and 2016

\begin{itemize}
\item  Machine Learning: Andrew Ng; Coursera
\item Introduction to Programming with MATLAB: Vanderbilt University; Coursera
\item Introduction to Computer Science using Python; EDX; MIT;
Other MOOCs partially completed
\item Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Keith Devlin
\item Machine Learning, Pedro Domingos
\item Introduction to Logic, Michael Genesereth
\item Artificial Intelligence, Berkeley, Dan Klein and Pieter Abbeel. 5. Differential Equations, Coursera, Paul Blanchard
\end{itemize}
