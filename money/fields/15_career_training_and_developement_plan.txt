WHAT ARE YOUR CAREER GOALS AND HOW WOULD THIS SCHOLARSHIP HELP TO ACHIEVE THEM

(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))




My career plan starts with attaining first class honours in my bsc if possible.

(I was lucky to be able to work as an intern (intern in the physics department) at the university, in the summer, between third and fourth year)

My career goals are to work in an exciting and up to date field in science. Neural Networks which would be my first choice. Having completed my bsc in 2018, I would like to work in research for a few years, hopefully in an exciting field such as neural networks, at the forefront of scientific discovery.

If I do not achieve a place at nuig. I will apply elsewhere.

And hopefully I will be lucky.


HOW WOULD THIS SCHOLARSHIP HELP ME ACHIEVE THESE CAREER GOALS


The Scholarship would catapult me forward. As doing a phd would give me opportunities and may lead to other exciting scientific adventures which may not have been discovered yet.

Working close with mentors at the university I could ask for guidance.

hone my skills
the academic environment is a positive place for me to cut my scientific teeth in.
to grow in.

I enjoy helping my colleges at college at present and we have interesting discussions and I am learning from them all the time too.

I would impart my knowledge. And there would be richer cross pollination of scientific ideas. Also I would feel kindly towards younger BSc students at NUIG, who needed help with tutorials.

Modern science requires team work and the synergy of a diverse spectrum of complimentary skill sets.

I want to contribute to this.

During my 3rd year summer internship I witnessed first hand collaboration between medical physicist, computational physicists, mathematicians and organizers and leaders as well as young phd students.

HOW WILL I GO ABOUT AQUIRING THE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE.

    -technical skills
    -communication skills
    -analytical skills.

(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

In my spare time I am continuing to add new computer languages to my compendium of knowledge.
I believe that problem solving requires seeing something from many angles.
The sapir-whorf conjecture suggests that the languages you use affect how you think.

Polyglotism I feel amplifies my general and problem solving intelligences.
I have completed textbooks and MOOCS IN

MATLAB
Python
Haskell
Prolog
C
Shell-Script
Linux Operating System customization.
Lisp
Prolog


The cornocopeia and history of computer languages fascinates, They all have different strengths and applications in different setting to help solve different problems.

I utilise computer programs to check calculations, perform dimensional analysis and implement new algorithms I learned in my BSc modules.

___________	
Programming Experience:

I enjoy learning to program in my spare time.
My favourite programming language is currently Mathematica.
I have used it throughout this year to check calculations, perform dimensional analysis and implement all the new algorithms I learned in my Computational Physics module.

HOW WOULD THIS SCHOLARSHIP ENABLE ME TO GAIN SKILLS RELEVANT TO EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC SECTOR.

    -technical skills
    -communication skills
    -analytical skills.

Becoming an expert at writing scientific papers,
following deep research
giving me time to work in an academic setting such as nuig,
which is not always the back ground to every scientists job,

And this is important to me as its in the univeristy setting, that the exciting discoveries are made.

patronage and time are two great factors as well as  an aura of teaching and learning and passing on skills.


machine learning is already used through a diverse range of industry.

it is even used in the post office to read hand writing on letters
mastery of this field would make into an employable and an excellent addition to the private sector work-force
