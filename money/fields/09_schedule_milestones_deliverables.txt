I have read papers on dermatology and medicine.

Year One:
Assess the performance and limitations of applying Deep Neural Networks to the task of detecting the presence or absence of Exo-Planets.

I would hope that this topic hasn't been done in the same way before,
But even if that was the case I can build and contribute to their code libraries
And this would accelerate the discovery of exoplanets.

I have also researched this topic online and to date have not yet found a similar scientific proposal.

The department could run out of money.

There could unknown unknowns that we cannot forsee.

Conundrums and complications are the essence of life itself.

If it was that easy it would have been sorted out long ago.

Yes there will be lot of small hurdles. But it is the job of a scientist to push on through to the delights of new discovery in the face of struggle.

I plan to keep fit and healthy, to study as hard as I can for the BSc and keep this flame of enthusiasm alive for the PHD if I hopefully achieve it.





Department could go on fire. and burn down.
My computer could break.

My proposed hypothesis could be difficult to implement. But this is highly unlikely as research has shown.(4)(5)
