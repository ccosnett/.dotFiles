In fourth year (Semester 1) we have 3 core subjects we all have to register for:

- Quantum Mechanics
- Solid State Physics
- Applied Optics

Then we have to choose one of 3 optional subjects:

- Atmospheric Physics and Climate change
- Biophotonics
- Astrophysics

In september I'm planning to register for Atmospheric Physics and Climate change. I think it looks the easiest.

Hope that answers your question.
