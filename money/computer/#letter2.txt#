Dear Rhys ,

I'm a physics student at Galway University.

I am looking to purchase a computer with 4 .
The computer will be




If possible, could you quote me a reasonable price for such a machine.

Obviously I would need excellent heat dispersal methods, reasonably fast CPU and an adequate power supply and at least 32 GB of RAM.

It would also be useful if it had extra Mother Board slots so if I needed more GPU's added in future I could do so.

This build would have to be resilient, with high quality components that would last a long time.

I would be grateful for your assistance in this matter.

Regards,

John Cosnett

P.S. My father has always bought his computers from you. (Greg Cosnett: gcosnett@eircom.net)
