- Last time I showed you a graph that was too good to be through.
- I discovered to my embarassment that the random number generator kept on resetting everytime I made a new Yorick instance.
- I thought I could fix it and redo the graph quickly. But it took me like a week.
- 
- it takes 17 hours to generate a single data point on my imac using Tensorflow.
- it was harder than i thought
- the random number-generator didn't work
- I have been trying to rent a cloud computer of jeff bezos for 70 cents an hour.

- Struggling to set up tensor flow on the cloud computer
- I found a nature paper.



40 82 percent accuracy. but the more planets the higher the accuracy.
the better the training.


I'm a bit embarassed
- when is this internship over?


- my mac doesn't work as the graphics card cannot communicate with tensor flow
